# Security-Labs

Hands-on computer security labs focused on foundational security concepts including
firewall configuration, vulnerability analysis, exploitation testing, and secure systems behavior.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of hands-on security labs completed as part of
Computer Systems Security coursework and independent experimentation. The work emphasizes
understanding real-world security vulnerabilities, system behavior, and defensive controls
in Linux-based environments.

## Lab Environments
- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu Linux
- pfSense Firewall
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- Virtualized lab environments (VMware / VirtualBox)

## Labs & Topics Covered

### 🔐 Firewall Configuration (pfSense)
- Configured firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic
- Tested rule effectiveness using simulated attack traffic
- Analyzed network flow behavior and logging

### 🧪 Vulnerability Scanning
- Performed vulnerability scans against intentionally vulnerable systems
- Interpreted scan results to identify common weaknesses
- Evaluated false positives and remediation strategies

### 💥 Exploitation Testing (DVWA)
- Explored common web vulnerabilities including:
  - SQL Injection
  - Command Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Observed how insecure input handling leads to compromise
- Emphasized defensive coding and mitigation techniques

### 🌐 ARP Spoofing
- Demonstrated ARP spoofing in controlled lab networks
- Observed man-in-the-middle attack behavior
- Analyzed network-level trust assumptions

### 🧠 Buffer Overflow Research
- Studied memory layout and stack behavior
- Explored how buffer overflows occur at a conceptual level
- Focused on understanding exploit mechanics and defensive mitigations

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Linux system administration and analysis
- Network security fundamentals
- Secure systems reasoning
- Vulnerability identification and impact analysis
- Ethical security testing in sandboxed environments

## Disclaimer
All work was performed in controlled lab environments for educational purposes only.
No testing was conducted against unauthorized systems.
